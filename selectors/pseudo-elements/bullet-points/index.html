    <p>`px` stands for "pixels" and is an absolute unit of measurement. One pixel is equal to one dot on a screen, and
      the size of a pixel is determined by the screen's resolution. `px` is commonly used for setting precise
      measurements, such as the width and height of an element.</p>
    <h3 class="section">Point 2</h3>
    <p> `em` stands for "em-height" and is a relative unit of measurement. One `em` is equal to the font-size of the
      element it is applied to. For example, if the font-size of a paragraph is `16px`, then `1em` is equal to `16px`.
      `em` is commonly used for setting measurements that are relative to the font-size of an element, such as the
      padding or margin around text. </p>
    <h3 class="section">Point 3</h3>
    <p>`rem` stands for "root em" and is also a relative unit of measurement. One `rem` is equal to the font-size of the
      root element (usually the `<html>` element). This means that `rem` is not affected by the font-size of the element
      it is applied to, and is commonly used for setting measurements that are relative to the root element, such as the
      width of a container.</p>
    <h3 class="section">Point 4</h3>
    <p> In general, `rem` is preferred over `em` for setting measurements that are relative to the root element, because
      it is not affected by the font-size of the element it is applied to. However, `em` can be useful for setting
      measurements that are relative to the font-size of an element, such as the spacing around text.</p>
