      <h3>Point 1</h3>
      <span class="link"><a href="#">Link</a></span>
      <p>Unit <span class="link"><a href="#">`px`</a> </span> stands for "pixels" and is an absolute unit of
        measurement. One pixel is
        equal to one dot on a
        screen, and
        the size of a pixel is determined by the screen's resolution. `px` is commonly used for setting precise
        measurements, such as the width and height of an element.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Point 2</h3>
      <p>Unit <span class="link"><a href="#">`px`</a></span> stands for "em-height" and is a relative unit of
        measurement. One `em` is
        equal to the font-size of
        the
        element it is applied to. For example, if the font-size of a paragraph is `16px`, then `1em` is equal to `16px`.
        `em` is commonly used for setting measurements that are relative to the font-size of an element, such as the
        padding or margin around text. </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Point 3</h3>
      <span class="link"><a href="#">Link</a></span>
      <p>Unit <span class="link"><a href="#">`px`</a></span> stands for "root em" and is also a relative unit of
        measurement. One `rem`
        is equal to the font-size
        of
        the
        root element (usually the `<html>` element). This means that `rem` is not affected by the font-size of the
        element
        it is applied to, and is commonly used for setting measurements that are relative to the root element, such as
        the
        width of a container.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Point 4</h3>
      <p> In general, `rem` is preferred over `em` for setting measurements that are relative to the root element,
        because
        it is not affected by the font-size of the element it is applied to. However, `em` can be useful for setting
        measurements that are relative to the font-size of an element, such as the spacing around text.</p>
